Domain name is a unique character string consisting of any combination of letters and numbers. This is an address where users can get access to the required website. The domain name helps users to present the address in a convenient form.


There are no restrictions for registering generic domains, they can be registered by any legal entity or individual. Generic domains most often mean a specific field of activity, for example:

.com — for commercial sites (company)
.mobi — for products and services of mobile communication sites
.jobs — for law companies or organizations
.tel — for Internet communication sites
.post — for postal sites
.org — non-commercial organizations (organization)
.edu — for educational institutions (education)
Because the .com domains have become very popular, not only commercial companies have started registering them. Also, a new category has been added to generic domains — «new generic domains ». They consist of the whole words, for example: .bank, .site, .shop, .website . The list of top-level domains is constantly growing. Summarizing, the division of generic domains into groups is seems to be very conditional.
